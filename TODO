* Looks like our package fails to load after the
  Thread package is loaded while current dir
  appears to be unchanged.

* Do we really need signal vector for initialization?
  Currently only creation of the table of event handlers
  could benefit from it, and the elements of the
  table of syncpoints are initially initialized to NULL.
  On the other hand, this might prove as being a more
  universal approach, especially if the table of syncpoints
  will change its format.
